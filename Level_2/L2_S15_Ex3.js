//Exercise 3

// Create a variable 'n' with the value 71
//create an 'if' statement that detects if variable 'n' is greater than 45.
//inside that 'if' statement, create another 'if' statement that detects if the same variable is smaller than 65.
//inside that 'if' statement, add a 'console.log' that shows the value of 'n'.
//the value of 'n' will not show initially even if you hit "Run".
//change the value of 'n' until it shows on the terminal.


//SOLUTION Ex.3

let n = 48; // e.g if u set variable of n = 71,it wont show any result, try changing until it shows.

if(n > 45){
    if(n < 65){
        console.log(n);
    }
}
