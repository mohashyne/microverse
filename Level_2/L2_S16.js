// 'While' loop
//computers are used to do very fast repetition using loops.
//e.g a computer can count a number of people in attendance very fast, a human have to count them one by one or tell them to raise their hands. we don't need any of that, which is called a loop.



// example of a loop that counts from '0' to '9'

//Display before
let i = 0; //if you change this number it will start from the declared value

while(i < 10){
    console.log(i);
    i++; //it will check the condition first and go back to check again if 'i' is smaller than '10' it will continue until the condition is met.
    //result 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. (we see the number before its increment)
}








/*

//Display after
let j = 0; //if you change this number it will start from the declared value

while(j < 10){
    j++; //it will check the condition first and go back to check again if 'i' is smaller than '10' it will continue until the condition is met.
    //result 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. (we see the number before its increment)
}
    console.log(j);
