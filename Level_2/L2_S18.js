// 'for' loop => same as 'while' loop but a lot more easier , you don't need to declare a variable & a value outside like a 'while' loop.

/*

In case we want to perform a math operation before a loop we can use this else , 'for' loop is better
let i = 0; 
while(i < 10){
    i++;
    console.log(i);
}  */
//result 1 - 10

//just use to separate codes
console.log("--------------------")

//much more common in programming
for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++){
  console.log(i);
} //result 0 - 9
