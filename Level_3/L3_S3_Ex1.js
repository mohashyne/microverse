// Please complete these steps before moving forward:

// Create a `for` loop that counts backwards in steps of 3, from 102 to 27

// Hint: you can set the initial value of `i` to something different than 0, and also, remember that you can decrement instead of increment in a for loop.


// SOLUTION

for(let i = 102; i >= 27; i -=3){
    console.log(i);
}
