//What arrays are and why they are useful
// array is just like a variable but it can contain many different values.

let arr = ["apple", "orange", "banana", 77, 95, 101];

console.log(arr);
//result apple, orange, banana, 77, 95, 101
console.log(arr[0]); // show the first index of an arr
//result 'apple' which is index of 1

//index of arrays starts from '0' => index '0' represents the first value.


//Arrays are used to organize values in a specific order
//they allow us to check values one-by-one and perform tasks with them, using a loop.
