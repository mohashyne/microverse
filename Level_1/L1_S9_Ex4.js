// Create the following variables

// A variable called greeting with the string "Hello my name is" as its value
//A variable called myName with your name as its value.
//A variable called str with the string "And i have" as its value.
//A variable called apples with any number you like.
//A variable end with the value "apples"

// combine all these variables in order using console.log() with commas, to create a phrase like "Hello my name is Oscar and i have 20 apples".
// of course in your case, the phrase should have your  name and your number instead of mine

let myName = "Muhammad";
