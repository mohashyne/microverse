// Feature of function arguments in javascript

function destroyer(arr){
    //argument object(it a built in)
    //console.log(arguments[0]);//use index number to view the values in the function;
    let output = 0
    //now let use create a variable to access the arr
    let input = arguments[0];
    console.log(input);
    
    /*
    //the rest
    console.log(arguments[1]);
    console.log(arguments[2]);
    console.log(arguments[3]);
    console.log(arguments[4]);
    console.log(arguments[5]); */
    
    //Shorthand 
    for(let i = 1; i < arguments.length; i++){
        console.log(arguments[i])
        output = arguments[i]
        
    }
   

        return arr;
    }
    
    
    
    //we are actually going to the first one which is the 'arr', and the rest is going to be of optional length(meaning we could have 2 or more arguments outside the array), the questions is how do we handle a variable amount of argument.
    //The answer is we are going to use a special built-in variable of javascript that is called "arguments object"
    destroyer([1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3], 2, 3, 5, 7, 6);
    
    // the challenge means you need to delete all the numbers present in your arr , that is already in the other argument
